description: Finish an issue — confirm acceptance, update docs/README, run the verification gate, push, open a closing PR, treat CI as advisory (skip when local e2e + pytest are green this session or no e2e surface touched; flake reruns once), auto-merge, delete branch, restart tray. Use "/issue-finish"; pairs with /issue-start.

# issue-finish

**Goal:** Take a finished feature branch all the way to merged-and-closed,
neatly. Invoking this skill is explicit authorization to commit, push, and merge.

## Pre-flight

Run in parallel; stop on any failure:
- `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` — must be `true`.
- `git branch --show-current` — must be a feature branch, not the main branch.
  If on main, stop: "Not on a feature branch — nothing to finish."
- Derive the **issue number** from the branch name (`feat/53-...` → `53`).
  If the branch carries no number, ask which issue this closes.
- Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` — verification gate command, docs discipline,
  any tray/restart procedure.
- **Detect the checkout mode** (drives the merge-land + cleanup in step 5):
  ```
  E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/worktree_claim.py mode <repo>
  ```
  prints `primary` (work in the shared checkout) or `worktree` (a linked
  `<repo>-wt-<N>` created by `/issue-start`'s concurrency path). Remember which;
  the two modes finish differently.

## Steps

### 1. Finalize the work

- `git status --porcelain` — if there are uncommitted changes, commit them now
  with a clear `type: summary` message (follow the Git section of `CLAUDE.md`;
  no AI-attribution trailer).
- Re-read the issue (`gh issue view <N>`) and confirm every acceptance point is
  actually met. If something is unmet, stop and say so — don't finish a partial
  issue.

### 2. Documentation

- Update `README.md` if usage, config, or output changed.
- Do **not** create a dated `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` changelog. The PR body, the
  closed issue, and `git log` already capture "what was done, files modified,
  validation run" — a third copy in `docs/` is busywork that ages badly. `docs/`
  is reserved for durable *design records* a future reader will actually
  re-open (architecture, testing strategy, etc.), not per-PR changelogs.
- Commit any documentation changes.

### 3. Verification gate

Run the gate the project's `CLAUDE.md` specifies (e.g.
`C:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe -File scripts/verify-before-ship.ps1`).
It must exit 0. Do not proceed on
a red gate. If the project has no checker, say so explicitly — never claim tests
passed when there are none.

### 3b. UX-conformance gate (web-app UX diffs only)

When the diff touches the web app's UX, confirm it still conforms to the fleet
design system **and** isn't visually broken — *before* the PR, so a drift-fix
commit lands in it. Convention + contract: `project-scaffolding#83`. The trigger
is deterministic, not a judgment call:

```
E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/ux_surface.py check .
```

- `SPEC_APPLIES=no` (non-web repo / Streamlit spike) **or** `TOUCHED=no` → the
  gate is a no-op. **State it** in the step-7 summary (`no UX surface touched`)
  and go to step 4. This is the common case and costs nothing.
- `TOUCHED=yes` → run both legs against the files in `MATCHED`:
  - **Token check (fix-now).** Compare the touched CSS custom properties (light
    **and** dark) and the nav contract to `~/.claude/design.md` +
    `design.dark.md`, and **fix material drift in this branch now**, committing
    it — do *not* file-and-defer a `design-drift` issue (that is `/design-sync`'s
    job for the periodic sweep; this gate's job is to not *introduce* drift).
    Materiality bar: a wrong canvas color, a missing dark theme, a hand-rolled
    nav, or a broken layout is a blocker; a 1-unit radius nitpick is not.
  - **Visual check (in-session only — never attach the image).** Launch the
    feature-branch working tree and look at the touched view via the `verify`
    skill (with `ux-full`, every `KEY_VIEWS` entry, not just the touched one).
    Inspect the render against the spec — nav pill, layout, palette. **The
    screenshot is for your eyes in this session only:** save it to a local
    scratch path, never commit it, and **never attach it to the PR body, an
    issue, or a comment.** Assume every repo is public — an uploaded UI
    screenshot is an information breach. Put a **text-only** conformance line in
    the PR instead (e.g. `Visual: touched view renders per spec — nav pill,
    layout, palette conform`).
    - **Browser-backend preflight (Codex — no live `iab`).** Before the drive,
      pick the backend deterministically: prefer the in-app Browser (`iab`) when
      `agent.browsers.list()` includes it; when it returns `[]`, fall back to
      installed Playwright with real Chrome — `iab` absence is **not** a reason
      to skip the visual leg (fleet-config#351). Get the plan (backend, venv,
      `channel="chrome"` launch kwargs honoring the browser-safety contract,
      the `KEY_VIEWS` × {light, dark} capture list, and the distinct
      capability-failure messages) from:
      ```
      E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/browser_verify.py plan . --base-url <app-root> --iab-available <yes|no>
      ```
      A missing Playwright, missing Chrome, unreachable app, or exhausted
      profile-lock each report distinctly (never one generic error). Background
      + recovery: `docs/codex-browser.md`. On Claude Code the `verify` skill's
      MCP browser is the `iab`-equivalent path — the fallback is for hosts with
      no live in-app backend.

**Overrides** (words in the finish invocation): `ux`/`design` forces the gate
even if `TOUCHED=no`; `no-ux` skips it; `ux-full` checks every `KEY_VIEWS`
entry. Always **state** the gate decision (ran / skipped / `ux-full`, plus any
drift fixed) in the step-7 summary so the user can veto.

### 4. Push and open the PR

- `git push -u origin <branch>`.
- `gh pr create` with a body containing: a short **Summary**, a **Validation**
  line (what gate ran and its result), and `Closes #<N>` so the issue
  auto-closes on merge. Match the PR-body style of recent merged PRs in the repo.
  Do **not** include the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` line at the bottom of the PR body.

### 5. Merge (CI is advisory — skip the wait when it adds no signal)

**CI is advisory, not a required gate.** The local verification gate (step 3) is
the contract; CI is supplementary. Its **only** signal beyond the local gate is
the **e2e suite** (when the local gate itself doesn't run it — it needs browsers
+ a live webapp), which is also the known-flaky leg. So a diff that touches none
of the e2e surface gains nothing from waiting, and neither does a diff whose
e2e coverage was already proven **locally, in this session** — a wedged remote
browser can block the merge for nothing either way. The decision below is driven
by the project's `## CI expectations` block (the convention is
`ferraroroberto/project-scaffolding#52`).

- **Read the project's `## CI expectations` block in `CLAUDE.md`.** It declares
  the workflow/job, the typical-green duration + investigate/wedged thresholds,
  the documented flaky leg, and the **e2e surface** paths. **Absent → fall back
  to the conservative behavior: always `--watch` (skip nothing)**, subject to
  the local-e2e-proof rule below. Do not invent thresholds or surface paths the
  block doesn't state.
- **Skip-the-wait when local e2e + pytest already proved it this session.** If
  step 3's gate is green **and** the project's end-to-end suite was actually run
  and passed in this same session (a local `verify`-style pass, or a gate
  command that itself boots the app and runs e2e) → skip the watch and merge
  immediately, **regardless of whether the diff touches declared e2e-surface
  paths** — CI's only signal beyond the local gate has already been produced
  locally. **State it** in the summary, e.g. `CI not awaited — local e2e +
  pytest green this session`.
- **Otherwise, skip-the-wait keyed on the e2e surface.** If local e2e did *not*
  run this session, fall back to the narrower rule: if the diff touches **none**
  of the declared e2e-surface paths and the local gate (step 3) is green → skip
  the watch and merge immediately. **State it** in the summary, e.g. `CI not
  awaited — store-only diff, no e2e surface touched`.
- **Otherwise watch — but proactively, not passively.** Run `gh pr checks <PR>
  --watch`. The moment elapsed crosses the block's **investigate threshold**,
  stop waiting passively: inspect the run (`gh run view <run-id> --job <job>`)
  and classify **flake vs real failure**.
  - **Real failure** (test assertion, compile/lint/type error, a leg that isn't
    the documented flaky one) → stop and report. **Never rerun a real failure.**
  - **Documented flaky leg wedged** (per the block — e.g. the Playwright
    WebKit/PTY-input leg) → cancel + rerun **once** automatically, saying so
    (`cancelled wedged <leg> run, rerunning once`). If it flakes a **second**
    time → stop and surface it to the user; do not rerun again.
- **Keep-control guardrails.** Always **state** the CI decision (skip vs wait,
  plus any cancel/rerun) in the finish summary so the user can veto. Auto-rerun
  is capped at **once** and only for the *documented* flaky leg. Nothing
  force-merges: CI is advisory (no branch protection), so no `--admin` is ever
  needed — but **if a repo later marks the `e2e` check *required*** in branch
  protection, the skip-rule must **fall back to watching** (a required check
  can't be skipped without `--admin`, which is out of scope here). This skips
  only the *remote CI wait*; it never skips the verification gate in step 3.
- `gh pr merge <PR> --merge --delete-branch` — merge commit; branch deleted on
  both remote and local.
- **Land + clean up, by checkout mode** (from pre-flight):
  - **Primary checkout:** `git checkout <main>` then `git pull --ff-only` to land
    the merge locally, then release the concurrency claim so the next session can
    own the primary:
    ```
    E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/worktree_claim.py release <repo>
    ```
    **Verify the release** — this is a hard acceptance step, not optional prose:
    a finisher that is not the acquiring session (build-and-stop → separate
    finisher, `/cleanup-fleet`, `/issue-finish-batch`) or an abbreviated finish
    must not silently skip it and leak the claim until the 8h TTL
    (fleet-config#174). Immediately run:
    ```
    E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/worktree_claim.py status <repo>
    ```
    and confirm it prints `CLAIM=free`. If it still shows `CLAIM=held`, the
    release did not take — re-run `release <repo>` and re-check before reporting
    the finish done.
  - **Linked worktree:** do **not** `git checkout <main>` — the primary checkout
    may belong to another live session; the merge is already authoritative on the
    remote. Instead `cd` out to the primary repo path (`<repo>`) and remove this
    worktree (the helper strips the `.venv` junction *before* `git worktree
    remove`, so the primary's real venv is never touched):
    ```
    E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/worktree_claim.py remove-worktree <repo>-wt-<N>
    ```
    A worktree session holds no primary claim, so there is nothing to release.
- Confirm the issue closed (`gh issue view <N>` → `CLOSED`). If it didn't
  auto-close, close it manually with a comment referencing the merge commit.
- Clear the issue's Fleet Board marker now that the merge is authoritative:
  ```
  E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/skills/_lib/active_issue.py remove <repo> <N>
  ```
  This runs **after** a successful merge, never when verification or CI stops
  the finish early — a failed finish is still in flight and must remain marked.
  The remove is idempotent (`ACTIVE_ISSUE=absent` is success), but a helper
  error is not: retry once and stop if it still cannot update the shared file.

### 6. Restart the tray (only if the project runs one)

If the project's `CLAUDE.md` describes a tray or long-running local process,
follow that procedure **exactly**. The non-negotiables:
- **Prefer the deterministic restart.** If the project ships a `tray.bat`
  with a `--restart` flag (the canonical orphan-proof reclaim-then-start —
  every fleet tray has one), run **`tray.bat --restart`** and nothing else.
  That single command does the subtree kill + per-`.venv` port reclaim + start
  atomically. **Do not** hand-roll a `Get-NetTCPConnection`/`taskkill` kill:
  a by-hand kill only catches the one listener it finds and misses the orphan
  the reclaim sweep exists to kill, then re-runs a start-only script.
- **Invoke it through a real Windows shell — never Git Bash's nested `cmd /c`.**
  Run the restart via the harness PowerShell tool, or
  `C:/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe -Command "& '<repo>/tray.bat' --restart"`
  (forward-slash exe path, per the Git-Bash-strips-backslashes rule). Launched
  through the Bash tool as `cmd /c "tray.bat --restart"`, Git Bash/MSYS rewrites
  `/c` to `C:/`; `cmd.exe` opens an interactive prompt and the batch/helper never
  runs. The call emits only the `cmd` banner, none of the batch's own `Stopping
  previous…` echoes, and leaves the old build untouched. Fire the PowerShell
  invocation non-blocking (the tray holds its console — a foreground launch
  never returns), then move to the bounded poll below.
- **Safety caveat — linked children.** `tray.bat --restart` does a `/T` subtree
  kill, so it is safe only for a tray whose linked-but-independent children
  (a session-host + its PTY-backed shells) are spawned **detached** and
  re-adopted on start (scaffold `docs/windows-tray.md`). Read the target repo's
  `CLAUDE.md` to know which case you're in — don't assume by app name. A tray
  that declares its linked children detach-compliant (e.g. `app-launcher`, per
  `project-scaffolding#35`: its `:8446` session-host is spawned via `cmd /c
  start` and re-adopted, so `--restart` preserves open Coding sessions and is
  safe even from inside one) is fine to restart. A tray that still hosts such
  children *in its subtree* — or is silent on the point — must be treated as
  unsafe: `--restart` would kill the user's open Coding sessions, and your own
  if you're inside one, so **confirm with the user first**, or use its
  non-destructive path (kill only the webapp port, let the tray re-adopt).
- **Fallback only** for a project with no `--restart`: kill **only** the
  specific process listening on the project's port (`Get-NetTCPConnection
  -LocalPort <port>`, stop that PID — **never** a blanket `python`/`pythonw`
  kill), then relaunch via its start script.
- Confirm the new build is live with a **bounded** poll of the project's
  version endpoint (e.g. `GET /api/version`): a **hard timeout + attempt cap**
  (≤30 s / fixed attempts), then **fail loud** — never an open-ended wait. The
  git SHA must match `HEAD` (a `/healthz` 200 is not enough — a stale process
  passes it) and the asset hash should have changed. Report that build line.
- **On a `git_sha` ≠ `HEAD` mismatch (a silent adopt-stale), stop and surface it
  to the user — do not improvise process kills.** A by-hand `taskkill`/
  `Get-NetTCPConnection` kill during recovery is exactly what the safe-restart
  rules warn against: it catches the one listener it finds, misses the orphan,
  and a mistimed single-PID kill can take the server fully down. The robust
  reclaim is the tray's job (`project-scaffolding#54` hardens `--restart` to
  reclaim and self-verify); the finisher's contract is to invoke it correctly
  and **report** a mismatch, not to hand-fix it.

If the project has no tray, skip this step.

### 7. Report

Summarize: issue closed, PR merged, branch deleted, docs updated (or why not),
gate result, the UX-conformance gate decision (ran / skipped / `ux-full`, plus
any drift fixed — step 3b), and the live build line.

Then append the **work-summary** — the file/LOC shape of what shipped — by
running the deterministic helper and echoing its output verbatim into the
report:

```
E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/hooks/work_summary.py --pr <PR_URL>
```

It prints the roll-up (`📊 +N −M · K files` + new/changed/deleted buckets) and a
churn-sorted per-file table (status · file · + · −) that renders here in chat. No
LLM, all from `gh`; it prints nothing on any `gh` error, so just skip the block
if it comes back empty. The same roll-up rides the Slack ping in step 8 — don't
re-assemble it by hand.

### 8. Slack notification

After the summary, fire the completion ping with the deterministic helper. It
resolves the channel/user from `projects.toml` and emits the one canonical
format. Run:

```
E:/automation/fleet-config/.venv/Scripts/python.exe C:/Users/rober/.claude/hooks/notify_complete.py --kind finish --issue <N> --pr <PR> --pr-url <PR_URL>
```

`<PR_URL>` is the full PR URL (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/31`) —
pass the URL you already have from `gh pr create` or `gh pr view`. This makes
the title/URL lookup CWD-independent so it works correctly from subagent
contexts where the shell's working directory may differ from the project root.
If no channel is configured it's a silent no-op, and it always exits 0, so a
notification failure can never block or delay anything.

**`notify_complete.py` is the ONLY sanctioned way to send this ping — do NOT use
any MCP Slack tool (search/send/etc.) to find a channel or post the ping.** The
helper resolves the destination channel deterministically from `projects.toml`;
picking a channel yourself is both a security violation (an agent-inferred
external write destination) and wrong (it may post to the wrong channel). If the
helper is a silent no-op because no channel is configured, that is the correct
outcome — do not "fix" it by reaching for Slack tools.
