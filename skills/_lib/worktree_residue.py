"""Classify a repo's extra registered worktrees for `/cleanup-fleet-all` teardown (fleet-config#1077).

Why this exists
----------------
Teardown's check 1 used to be one line of prompt prose: `git worktree list`
must show the primary only, anything else is residue, and residue halts the
whole run. That rule exists to stop the run building on its *own* dirt, and it
is right for that. It was wrong for a worktree the run never created.

On 2026-09-27 a chief-dispatched lane in another repo created
`facilitation-suite-wt-nav-41af40a` about ten minutes after the scheduled run's
pre-flight. Pre-flight defers repos that already hold a worktree
(`repo_preflight.py`), but this one appeared later. It was clean, and its
branch was already squash-merged. When the run later shipped a lane in that
repo, teardown saw a second registered worktree, called it residue, and halted
with 41 issues never started.

This module is the classification teardown now runs instead of reading the
list itself. Each registered worktree past the primary gets exactly one class:

  own               -- created by this run (see below). Residue, halts.
  foreign-dirty     -- someone else's, with uncommitted work. Residue, halts.
  foreign-unmerged  -- someone else's, clean, but its HEAD is not proven
                       merged into the default branch. Residue, halts.
  foreign-merged    -- someone else's, clean, HEAD proven merged. Reported;
                       the caller defers the rest of that repo's work.
  unknown           -- a fact could not be established. Halts, like residue.

**"Created by this run"** is decided from what the caller passes in, never
from the worktree itself: the run knows every worktree path and branch its own
lanes reported or would have created (`<repo>-wt-<N>` for every issue `N` it
holds for that repo), and passes them as `--own-worktree` / `--own-branch`. A
registered worktree whose path *or* checked-out branch matches any of them is
`own`. Everything else is foreign. The match errs toward `own` on purpose: a
coincidental hit only restores the old halt, which is safe; a miss would let
the run step past its own dirt, which is what the halt exists to prevent.

**"Merged"** needs positive proof, read offline from git alone against the
remote default branch (`origin/<default>`, fetched first; a failed fetch only
makes proof harder, which only makes the verdict more conservative):

  1. the worktree's HEAD is an ancestor of `origin/<default>`, or
  2. `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/<default> <HEAD>` produces exactly
     `origin/<default>`'s own tree -- merging it would change nothing, which
     is what a squash-merged branch looks like. (`git branch --merged` is
     useless here: the fleet squash-merges, so the original tip is never an
     ancestor -- fleet-config#567.)

Neither proof → `foreign-unmerged`, i.e. today's halt. A branch whose squash
was later edited on the same lines conflicts in step 2 and halts too; that is
the conservative direction.

The overall verdict is `clean` (no extra worktree), `foreign-deferred` (every
extra worktree is `foreign-merged`), `residue` (any `own`, `foreign-dirty` or
`foreign-unmerged`), or `unknown`. Only `clean` and `foreign-deferred` pass
teardown's check 1.

This helper never removes, prunes, or touches a worktree -- a foreign one is
not the run's to remove.

Subcommand
----------
  classify <repo-path> [--own-worktree PATH]... [--own-branch NAME]... [--no-fetch]
        Prints one line per extra worktree:
          WORKTREE=<path> BRANCH=<name|(detached)> CLASS=<class> REASON=<why>
        then `VERDICT=<verdict>`, plus `REASON=` when the list itself could
        not be read and `NOTE=` when the fetch failed. Always exits 0 -- it
        reports, the caller decides.

The decision core (`is_own`, `classify_worktree`, `overall_verdict`) is pure
and unit-tested in `tests/test_worktree_residue.py`, alongside real-git
fixtures for each class. stdlib only.
