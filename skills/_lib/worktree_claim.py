"""Concurrency primitive for the issue-* skills: claim-or-worktree.

Two top-level agent sessions working the **same** repo used to collide because
they shared one working directory — a `git checkout` in session B rewrote the
tree under session A mid-build (fleet-config#143). The collision window is not
branch-cut time; it is the minutes-long *study* phase before an agent writes
anything. By the time the second agent cuts its branch, the damage is done.

The fix is first-come-first-served, claimed at the **very first action**:

  - The first session to `acquire` a repo wins its **primary checkout** and works
    on `main` in place, exactly as before.
  - Every session after that gets `MODE=worktree` and builds in an isolated
    sibling worktree (`<repo>-wt-<N>`) on its own branch, sharing the repo's
    object store. Separate HEAD + separate files ⇒ no checkout/HEAD race.
  - `release` (on finish, from the primary) frees the claim for the next session.

The claim is a directory published **atomically, fully populated** (meta.json
included) via a temp-dir-then-`rename` under the repo's *common* git dir
(`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), which every worktree of the repo shares —
so the claim is visible from the primary checkout and from every linked
worktree (see `_publish_claim`; a bare `mkdir`-then-write-`meta.json` let two
racers both win, fleet-config#334). Exactly one racer wins the rename; the
rest fall through to worktree mode. A crashed session's claim is reclaimed
once it ages past the TTL (no fragile PID-liveness check on Windows).

Windows-specific by design (the fleet is Windows): worktree `.venv` is a
**junction** to the primary's `.venv` (`mklink /J`) — worktrees don't share
untracked files, and a 24-repo fleet can't recreate heavy venvs per worktree.
The teardown order is load-bearing: a junction MUST be stripped with
`rmdir` (reparse-safe, no `/s`) BEFORE `git worktree remove`, or git's recursive
delete follows the junction and wipes the *real* venv (proven the hard way; same
junction footgun as uninstall.ps1, fleet-config#136).

`.venv` isn't always the only gitignored path a repo's own gate needs — a
vendored install (`local-llm-hub`'s `vendor/comfyui/`), a model cache, and
similar never make it into a fresh worktree either, so that repo's own test
suite can never pass there even though the build itself succeeds
(fleet-config#620). A repo declares extra ones in its own `.fleet.toml`:

    [worktree]
    extra_junctions = ["vendor/comfyui"]

`worktree_junction_targets` reads this declaratively; `.venv` is always
junctioned first and remains the *only* target when no `.fleet.toml` /
`[worktree]` table is present, so an undeclared repo behaves exactly as
before. Every target — `.venv` and each declared extra — goes through the
same junction-then-reparse-safe-teardown path in `setup_worktree` /
`remove_worktree`; a declared path that doesn't exist in the primary is
simply skipped, never a setup failure.

`git worktree add` populates tracked files only, so a repo's own gitignored
runtime config (`config/webapp_config.json`, `config/apps.json`, ... whatever
each repo's own `config.json`-pattern requires) never makes it into the new
worktree. Left unfixed, an e2e suite that boots a disposable webapp+session-host
hits its own missing-config guard for nearly every test and mass-skips silently
-- the pre-ship gate still reports green (fleet-config#470). `setup_worktree`
copies the primary's `config/*.json` (excluding `*.sample.json` templates) into
the worktree right after the checkout is created. The primary's gitignored
`.env` is mirrored the same way, right after `config/*.json`: a repo whose
startup path reads a secret or setting from `.env` (e.g. `local-llm-hub`'s
`LOCAL_LLM_HUB_SSH_KEY`) otherwise stalls on the missing value until an
unrelated timeout trips the e2e stage red (fleet-config#698).

Some repos keep their runtime config at the repo **root** instead of under
`config/` (`accounting-quarterly`'s `config.json` and
`classification_rules.json`, `home-automation`'s `devices.json`). Neither
`copy_runtime_config` nor `copy_env_file` covers that shape, so a worktree for
one of these repos crashed on startup with no config at all, discovered the
hard way mid-audit-rework on `accounting-quarterly#78` (fleet-config#714).
`copy_root_config` closes it right after `.env`: rather than hardcode which
root filenames matter, it asks `git check-ignore` which of the repo's own
root-level `*.json` files are gitignored, so a repo that adds a new one is
covered with no code change here. Same rules as `copy_runtime_config` --
`*.sample.json` excluded, an existing destination left alone, a top-level
`port` repointed via `_repoint_config_port`, machine-bound values blanked via
`blank_machine_bound_config` -- reused rather than reinvented.

A byte-verbatim copy is not safe by itself: a repo's config can point at a
real, machine-bound sink outside the worktree -- a synced mirror/backup
folder, an index path, another repo's database -- and a worktree instance
booted for a "ready to validate" handoff then reads and writes the owner's
**real** data (`task-os#80`, fleet-config#713). `copy_runtime_config` blanks
those values right after the port rewrite, the same way and in the same
per-file loop. A repo declares exactly which dotted keys are machine-bound in
its own `.fleet.toml`:

    [worktree]
    blank_config_keys = ["mirror.dir", "mirror.backup_dir", "search.folder_roots"]

`worktree_blank_config_keys` reads this the same way `worktree_junction_targets`
reads `extra_junctions`. A repo that declares nothing (no `.fleet.toml`, no
`[worktree]` table, or the table without a `blank_config_keys` key) falls back
to a conservative built-in default: any string value, anywhere in the config,
that looks machine-bound -- an `{onedrive}`-style placeholder, or an absolute
Windows path -- is blanked, list entries filtered the same way. An empty
string is what the app already treats as "feature off" (task-os's mirror does
today); a repo whose own gate needs to keep a value opts out per key by
declaring `blank_config_keys` explicitly (an empty list disables the default
heuristic entirely). Independently of either mode, keys declared in
`[worktree] secret_config_keys` are removed from the copy outright
(fleet-config#839) -- see `worktree_config.py`'s docstring.

The port-allocation and config-blanking machinery behind the three `copy_*`
functions above lives in `worktree_config.py` (fleet-config#731), imported
and re-exported here so every existing caller keeps addressing it as
`worktree_claim.<name>`.

Subcommands:

  acquire <repo-root> [--issue N] [--branch B] [--ttl-hours H] [--force-worktree]
      Atomically claim the primary checkout. Prints `MODE=primary` (work in
      place) or `MODE=worktree` (caller then calls setup-worktree). Reclaims a
      claim older than the TTL, or one whose recorded branch no longer exists
      (merged-and-deleted => leaked claim, self-heals on the next acquire).

      Worktree mode is **forced**, with no primary attempt, whenever either
      `--force-worktree` is passed OR `APP_LAUNCHER_SESSION_ID` is set (an
      App-Launcher-dispatched session: a machine chose the work, not a human).
      Set `WORKTREE_CLAIM_ALLOW_PRIMARY=1` to defeat the environment trigger
      for a dispatched flow that genuinely must hold the primary; an explicit
      `--force-worktree` still wins over it. Enforcing this in the tool rather
      than in skill prose is deliberate -- fleet-config#525 first shipped as a
      SKILL.md instruction and a dispatched worker ignored it inside the hour.

      `--force-worktree` skips the claim attempt entirely and always prints
      `MODE=worktree` (fleet-config#515). The claim only protects against a
      second *claiming session*; a live production process sitting in the same
      directory — the launcher webapp, home-automation's tray, or fleet-config's
      own hooks/ + skills/ junctioned into every live `~/.claude` — is not a
      claim holder, so a first-and-only unattended agent legitimately wins
      `MODE=primary` and edits files that a running app is serving. Unattended
      fleet-fanout dispatch (cleanup-fleet, cleanup-fleet-all, codebase-audit's
      security self-heal) therefore never works a primary checkout, for any
      repo. Interactive single-session `/issue-start` keeps the default
      claim-or-worktree behaviour.

  setup-worktree <repo-root> <issue-N> <branch>
      `git worktree add <repo>-wt-<N> <branch>` — created off the default
      branch, or off `origin/<branch>` when the branch is already pushed, or
      checked out in place when it already exists locally (fleet-config#602) —
      + junction `.venv` and any repo-declared `[worktree] extra_junctions` (fleet-config#620)
      into it, then copy the primary's gitignored `config/*.json` runtime
      config (excluding `*.sample.json` templates, which are already tracked)
      into the worktree, blanking machine-bound path values along the way
      (repo-declared `[worktree] blank_config_keys`, or a conservative
      default heuristic -- fleet-config#713) and removing any repo-declared
      `[worktree] secret_config_keys` on top (fleet-config#839). Prints
      `WORKTREE=<path>`.

  release <repo-root>
      Remove the primary claim. Idempotent. (Worktree sessions never hold it.)

  assert-owner <repo-root> <issue-N>
      Guard before a primary-tree `git checkout <main>` (issue-finish step 5,
      issue-start step 4): refuses (exit 1) if the tree is dirty or the claim
      is held by a *different* issue; passes (exit 0) if the tree is clean and
      the claim is free or already owned by <issue-N>. Fleet-config#473.

  land-primary <repo-root> <issue-N>
      Make a worktree lane's merge *live*: fast-forward the primary checkout,
      or report why it couldn't. Same guard as assert-owner (clean tree, claim
      free or owned by <issue-N>) plus "already on the default branch", then
      a guarded `merge --ff-only` (untrack_guard.py: every live file the merge
      untracks is kept, fleet-config#1086) and a `rev-list --count
      HEAD..origin/<default>` check. Prints one `PRIMARY=live behind=0` /
      `PRIMARY=stale reason=<why>` line in every outcome -- the line the finish
      summary quotes -- plus `RESTORED_UNTRACKED=` / `KEPT_ASIDE=` lines when
      the guard kept a file. Exit 0 only when
      live. Never checks out, stashes or forces the primary: a refusal is
      reported, not recovered. Fleet-config#647.

      A fourth guard refuses a tree a **live process is serving**
      (fleet-config#665): repos declaring `tray_cmd` in `hooks/projects.toml`
      run a long-lived server out of their checkout, and fast-forwarding one
      leaves static assets on disk ahead of the Python held in memory -- a UI
      served from two commits at once. `live_service_check` decides it,
      `probe_service` establishes it from the OS listener table -- both in
      `skills/_lib/worktree/service_probe.py`, imported here (fleet-config#680: the
      question is generic, the claim FSM is just its first caller). (Port absent
      from it = safely idle; unreadable table, or no port to probe = refuse,
      an unestablished fact is never a pass). There is no "landed anyway"
      variant: both landing and refusing need the same restart, and only
      landing serves mixed-commit assets meanwhile. `fleet-config` declares no `tray_cmd` and still lands
      unconditionally -- landing it is exactly what makes a merge live through
      the `~/.claude` junctions.

      That guard asks its question *after* "is there anything to pull?"
      (fleet-config#671): a tree already level with its remote is landed by
      definition, so a service serving it is irrelevant and the answer is
      `PRIMARY=live behind=0`, exit 0 -- reporting `stale` for a demonstrably
      live deploy inverts the unknown-is-not-pass rule by downgrading an
      *established* fact. The count is taken against a freshly fetched remote
      ref; a fetch or count that fails leaves it unknown, which takes the
      ordinary path through the service guard rather than a shortcut.

  remove-worktree <worktree-path> [--force-nonstandard-name]
      Reparse-safe teardown: strip the .venv junction, then
      `git worktree remove --force` + `git worktree prune`. Tolerates a
      worktree that git already deregistered while its directory survived
      (fleet-config#526) -- it resolves the primary by inverting the
      `<repo>-wt-<N>` convention and falls back to a plain delete, always
      after the junction strip. Exits 1, naming the path, if the tree is
      still there afterwards (a live process is holding a file inside it);
      the caller must report that as residue, never as a clean teardown.
      The usual holder is a leaked e2e browser helper -- `remove_worktree`'s
      docstring names the sweep to run before retrying.

      Refuses (exit 2, deletes nothing) unless the target actually **is** a
      linked worktree: a primary checkout (`--git-common-dir` == `--git-dir`)
      is rejected outright, and a path whose basename doesn't match the
      `<repo>-wt-<N>` convention is rejected unless `--force-nonstandard-name`
      is passed. An agent that confuses this subcommand's `worktree_path` arg
      with every sibling subcommand's `repo_root` arg previously got the
      primary checkout `rmtree`'d -- fleet-config#589, which destroyed a
      repo's gitignored personal data that existed nowhere else.

  status <repo-root>
      Print the current claim holder (if any) and `git worktree list`.
