    """1 when the tree survived, naming its likely holder; else release its ports, 0.

    **When the removal fails as "busy", suspect a leaked browser helper**
    (project-scaffolding#203): a Playwright/WebKit helper left by an e2e run
    inherits pytest's cwd, so a run inside `<repo>-wt-<N>` leaves helpers whose
    **current working directory** is the worktree, and Windows will not delete
    a live process's cwd. The holder may be genuinely **running**, or wedged mid-exit
    (fleet-config#705): `ExitStatus` set so `GetExitCodeProcess`/`taskkill`
    report it gone, but `GetProcessTimes` shows no exit time, Toolhelp32 shows
    a live thread, and its cwd handle is still held. Windows keeps an
    already-exited process's object (and its `tasklist`/WMI row) alive only
    while *some* handle to it remains -- that alone does not rule out this
    wedged state, so "the sweep calls it exited" is not proof the worktree is
    safe to retry.

    Diagnosing and clearing that is the e2e harness's job, not this module's.
    Run the adopting repo's own standalone sweep through its venv interpreter,
    then retry the teardown:

        <repo>/.venv/Scripts/python.exe tests/e2e/_browser_sweep.py <worktree-path> [--dry-run]

    Pointer only -- the sweep reads each process's cwd from its PEB (Win32 has
    no accessor for it) and lives in `project-scaffolding`'s e2e harness, which
    reports a wedged holder as `wedged:pins-scope` and exits non-zero when the
    path is pinned (project-scaffolding#236). Never reimplement it here.

    **A `wedged:pins-scope` verdict means retrying the teardown will not
    help** -- nothing can reap a wedged process. The directory is freed by
    closing the holder's cwd handle remotely (`RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS
    .CurrentDirectory.Handle` from its PEB, then `NtDuplicateObject(...,
    DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE)`), not by killing or rebooting -- rebooting the
    host was tried (home-automation#581) and the directories came straight
    back. Working implementation: `home-automation`'s `scripts/unpin_directory.py`.
