    Pure decision for the `land-primary` guard (fleet-config#647). A worktree
    lane's merge is authoritative on the remote but *not live* until the
    primary tree is fast-forwarded -- acutely so in this repo, where `hooks/`
    and `skills/` reach `~/.claude` through junctions rooted at the primary, so
    a merged hook or skill change does nothing fleet-wide until that tree moves.

    The landing is a fast-forward and nothing else (guarded by
    `untrack_guard`, fleet-config#1086). `owner_check` supplies
    the "is this tree anyone else's to touch?" half; the branch check enforces
    the other half -- only ever pull a tree *already sitting on* its default
    branch, because a worktree lane must never `git checkout` the primary.
    `behind` and `service` are passed in exactly as `holder` / `dirty` /
    `current_branch` are, so the whole decision stays pure and unit-testable
    with no git and no network inside it -- and so omitting either is a
    `TypeError` at the call site rather than a silently skipped guard.

    `behind` is how many commits the tree is behind its remote default branch,
    or `None` when that could not be counted. **Zero short-circuits the service
    guard** (fleet-config#671): there is nothing to fast-forward, so no live
    process can be skewed by a landing that isn't going to happen, and the tree
    is already exactly what the merge produced. Refusing there reported `stale`
    for a demonstrably live deploy -- downgrading an established fact, the
    mirror image of the unknown-is-not-pass rule the rest of this guard exists
    to uphold, and the one outcome that trains a reader to ignore the line. An
    *unknown* count is not zero: it falls through to the service guard, which
    refuses on its own terms. The earlier guards still speak first -- a dirty
    or off-branch primary reports its own reason however far behind it is.
