"""Shared resolution for the hooks-state base directory (fleet-config#817).

Every `skills/_lib` module that persists advisory state under
`~/.claude/hooks/state/` re-derived this exact `CLAUDE_HOOKS_STATE_DIR`
override lookup independently (`active_issue.py`, `chief_managed.py`,
`quota_snapshot.py`, `rate_gate.py` -- plus four more hook-tree copies fixed
alongside this one, `hooks/_lib.py`'s own `state_dir()`). This is a
correctness contract, not a style point: hermetic acceptance runs depend on
the env var being honoured everywhere, so a ninth caller that re-derives it
by hand risks getting it wrong and writing into live fleet state during a
test run.

Also owns the atomic-write temp naming + age sweep (fleet-config#864) and the
shared write body around them (fleet-config#1441) for writers into that
directory, mirroring `hooks/_lib.py`'s copy -- the tree
boundary forbids either tier importing the other's.

stdlib only.
