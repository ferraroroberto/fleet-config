"""Is a fleet repo's declared long-running service listening right now, and at
which commit? (fleet-config#680, lifted out of `worktree_claim.py`.)

The capability grew inside the worktree-claim FSM because `land-primary`'s
fourth guard needed it first (fleet-config#665): fast-forwarding a checkout a
tray/webapp is *serving* leaves static assets on disk ahead of the Python
holding them in memory, so the claim lifecycle had to ask whether anything was
up before landing a merge. Nothing about the question is worktree-specific --
`/issue-finish`, `restart_and_verify_webapp`, and any future health sweep want
the same answer -- and reaching it meant importing the 1400-line claim module.
So it lives here, and `worktree_claim` imports it.

Three concerns, in dependency order:

  - the **vocabulary**: `SERVICE_LIVE` / `SERVICE_ABSENT` / `SERVICE_UNKNOWN`,
    three states rather than a boolean, because "nothing is listening" is a
    positive finding and "the probe could not be completed" is the absence of
    one (the fleet rule that an unestablished fact reports as its own state);
  - the **pure verdict**, `live_service_check`, which turns a declaration plus
    a probe result into `(ok, reason)` with no I/O in it at all -- unit-tested
    exhaustively in `tests/test_worktree_claim.py`;
  - the **impure probe**: `declared_service` (read the declaration out of
    `hooks/projects.toml`), `listening_ports` (the OS's own TCP listener
    table), `_running_sha` (best-effort `git_sha` off the declared version
    endpoint), and `probe_service` / `service_state` tying them together.

stdlib only, and no import of `worktree_claim` -- the dependency runs one way.

    """Decide whether a long-running process forbids fast-forwarding this tree.

    Pure half of the fourth `land-primary` guard (fleet-config#665). `#647`
    asked three questions -- is the claim mine, is the tree clean, is it on its
    default branch -- and all three were satisfied when the `app-launcher#773`
    lane fast-forwarded a primary whose tray was *serving* it, leaving two
    static files on disk ahead of the Python holding them in memory.

    The asymmetry decides the default. **Not** landing leaves disk and process
    both at the old commit: behind, but coherent. **Landing** leaves disk new
    and process old: behind *and* skewed, serving one UI out of two commits.
    Both need the same restart, so refusing costs nothing the restart won't
    fix, and there is deliberately no "landed anyway" success variant.

    `declared` is the repo's `hooks/projects.toml` `tray_cmd` declaration --
    the fleet already distinguishes exactly the right set, and `fleet-config`
    declaring none is correct: nothing runs out of it and landing it is what
    makes a merge live through the `~/.claude` junctions. `probe` is what the
    live check established (`SERVICE_LIVE` / `SERVICE_ABSENT` /
    `SERVICE_UNKNOWN`); a probe that could not be completed is **not** proof of
    absence, so it refuses. Every refusal names the restart as the remedy, so
    an operator reads it as work parked rather than a tool that broke.

    Two parsing rules, deliberately not the state word alone: a row is a

    non-English Windows, and a parse that silently matched nothing would report
