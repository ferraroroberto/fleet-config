"""Chief-managed session marker (fleet-config#443).

`chief_ops.py dispatch` writes a marker here immediately after spawning a
worker session, so `hooks/notify_on_idle.py` can tell a chief-dispatched
worker apart from a human-started one and route its "blocked on input"
notification to chief instead of the human ping. A different concern from
`active_issue.py`'s issue-branch lifecycle (this is session identity for
notification routing, keyed by session id, not by repo#issue), so a
separate state file rather than overloading that schema — but the same
I/O idiom (24h TTL prune, atomic temp-file replace, a lock dir serializing
the read-modify-write) is reused directly from `active_issue` (`state_file`,
`_now`, `_iso_z`, `prune_rows`), not re-derived, since concurrent dispatches
are exactly the race that module's locking already solves.

The file is advisory and self-healing, same as `active-issues.json`: a
missing/corrupt read is empty, not fatal, and a marker that outlives its
session is harmless — `notify_on_idle` only ever *reads* it to decide
routing, it never trusts it as proof a session is alive.

This module is the **writer only**. The one reader is
`hooks/notify_on_idle.chief_managed_state()` (used by it and by
`block_askuserquestion_chief`), which keeps its own read logic per the
hooks/skills_lib tree-independence convention and returns a reason alongside
the verdict so "not managed" and "could not tell" stay distinct. A second
reader here was removed as dead (fleet-config#850) — query the marker through
that function, not by adding one back.
