"""Shared "enumerate the fleet + resolve a repo's committed default branch"
logic behind /config-map's and /system-map's `build_data.py` (fleet-config#318),
plus the filesystem-crawl half (`is_fleet_repo` / `iter_fleet_repos`) that
/audit-fleet's and /design-sweep's scanners share (fleet-config#561).

It also owns reading the fleet list itself. `hooks/projects.toml` is
machine-local and gitignored (a tracked `hooks/projects.toml.example` carries
the committed shape), and its `[global] architecture_ignore` array is the
fleet-scope switch: a repo listed there is out of every fleet-wide run. See
`docs/fleet-scope.md`.

Both skills derive their per-repo data from the same `hooks/projects.toml`
membership list, and both need each repo's committed default branch (to read
state from `origin/HEAD`, independent of whatever branch the repo happens to
be checked out on) — before this module existed, `config-map/build_data.py`
and `system-map/build_data.py` each carried a copy-pasted `fleet_repos`/
`_default_ref` pair. One shared pair now backs both; each `build_data.py`
keeps a thin same-named wrapper (its own `PROJECTS_TOML` default) so its call
sites and public API are unchanged.

stdlib + the `git` CLI only (via `skills/_lib/git_run`).
